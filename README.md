# PUBG-DS-project-Lets-Upgrade
PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds (PUBG) has enjoyed massive popularity. With over 50 million copies
sold, it's the fifth best selling game of all time, and has millions of active monthly players.
The team at PUBG has made official game data available for the public to explore and scavenge outside
of "The Blue Circle." This competition is not an official or affiliated PUBG site - Kaggle collected data made
possible through the PUBG Developer API.
You are given over 65,000 games' worth of anonymized player data, split into training and testing sets,
and asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player ratings
Tasks:-
1. Read the dataset.
2. Check the datatype of all the columns.
3. Find the summary of all the numerical columns and write your findings about it.
4. The average person kills how many players?
5. 99% of people have how many kills?
6. The most kills ever recorded are how much?
7. Print all the columns of the dataframe.
8. Comment on distribution of the match's duration. Use seaborn.
9. Comment on distribution of the walk distance. Use seaborn.
10. Plot distribution of the match's duration vs walk distance one below the other.
11. Plot distribution of the match's duration vs walk distance side by side.
12. Pairplot the dataframe. Comment on kills vs damage dealt, Comment on maxPlace vs numGroups.
13. How many unique values are there in 'matchType' and what are their counts?
14. Plot a barplot of ‘matchType’ vs 'killPoints'. Write your inferences.
15. Plot a barplot of ‘matchType’ vs ‘weaponsAcquired’. Write your inferences.
16. Find the Categorical columns.
17. Plot a boxplot of ‘matchType’ vs ‘winPlacePerc’. Write your inferences.
18. Plot a boxplot of ‘matchType’ vs ‘matchDuration’. Write your inferences.
19. Change the orientation of the above plot to horizontal.
20. Add a new column called ‘KILL’ which contains the sum of following columns viz. headshotKills,
teamKills, roadKills.
21. Round off column ‘winPlacePerc’ to 2 decimals.
22. Take a sample of size 50 from the column damageDealt for 100 times and calculate its mean. Plot
    it on a histogram and comment on its distribution.
